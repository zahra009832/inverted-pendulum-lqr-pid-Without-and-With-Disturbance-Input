# inverted-pendulum-lqr-pid-Without-and-With-Disturbance-Input

Reproducible simulation of a **nonlinear cart–pendulum** system comparing **PID** and **LQR** control, with and without a disturbance. Includes a nonlinear plant model, upright linearization, MATLAB script, and Simulink files.

For model background and equations, see **1.pdf** (this repo’s copy of `1.pdf`).
